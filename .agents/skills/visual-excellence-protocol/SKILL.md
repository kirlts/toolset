# Visual Excellence Verification

This skill operationalizes the `.agents/rules/06-aesthetics.md` rule. Its function is to verify that each visual artifact has its own identity and is not exclusively a generic product of the model's statistical distribution. It does NOT define the aesthetic laws (which are handled by the rule), but strictly enforces them before artifact delivery.

## Phase 0: Reference Loading

`.agents/knowledge/ai-smell-registry.md` is loaded to obtain the Convergence Blacklist (CBL) encompassing the 10 vectors and their exact values. This operation is internal and silent.

## Phase 1: Contextual Audit (Internal)

1. **Brownfield Check:** Existing style files (CSS, tailwind.config, theme) are inspected. Legacy constraints are identified.
2. **Interchangeability Test:** "If I substitute the logo for that of a generic entity, would this copy/layout still apply?" If the answer is yes, the artifact lacks domain anchoring.

## Phase 2: Verification Gates

Mandatory verification before delivering any visual artifact.

### Gate A. Anti-Slop (mechanical, binary)

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| ≥3 artifact values match CBL without domain justification | BLOCK → rewrite with domain-specific values |
| ≥1 Unicode emoji used as a UI icon | BLOCK |
| ≥1 link points to `#` without being a declared placeholder | BLOCK |
| A CTA uses literal strings from the CBL without rewriting to the domain | BLOCK |

### Gate B. Intentional Harmony (cognitive)

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| A visual decision violates the laws defined in `06-aesthetics.md` | BLOCK → residue of statistical inertia |
| Hover elements are not interactive, or focusable without `:focus-visible` | BLOCK |
| Empty space does not communicate semantic grouping (Gestalt) | BLOCK → generic padding |

### Gate C. Contextual Integrity (brownfield)

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| MASTER-SPEC §4 constraints or existing project design systems not respected | BLOCK |
| Harmony law contradicts legacy constraint | BLOCK → declare to user and request verdict |

## Output Mandate

Upon delivering the artifact, the system explicitly communicates in standard technical language:
1. The reference design logic applied.
2. The deviations executed regarding the AI convergence values.
3. Justification for any matches with convergence values.
